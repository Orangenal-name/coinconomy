## Coinconomy for shops

If you want to have a minecraft server that has an economy, but don't want something as overused as balances, or use just diamonds, then this is the plugin for you!

### What it does

Coinconomy allows you to have coins in game - with special codes so that people can't make their own. It also adds a trading system where people can pay coins for items.

### Commands

/coingenerate, /cg, /coingen - These allow op's to create new coins to put into the economy, like the money printers the government has!<br>
/coindelete, /cd, /coindel - These allow op's to delete a coin if they are holding one, and might not be useful unless someone dupes coins!<br>
/cointrade, /ct - This allows you to trade your coins with another player, so you can buy something from them or sell something to them!
/scam - make a report that you've been scammed to the op's, they'll try and sort this out!
